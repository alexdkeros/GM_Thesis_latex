 \chapter{Theoretical Background} \label{chap:theorBack}

The present chapter contains the necessary background knowledge used throughout the length of this thesis. Section~\ref{sec:theorBack-GM} describes the \emph{``Geometric Approach to Monitoring Threshold Functions over Distributed Data Streams''} in detail, as formulated by I.Sharfman, A.Shuster, D.Keren \cite{GM-sharfmanShusterKeren}. Section~\ref{sec:theorBack-MOP} presents \emph{multi-objective optimization} and  dives into the algorithms used in our implementation. Section \ref{sec:theorBack-MWMGraphs} discusses \emph{graph maximum weight matching} used for node pairing and, finally, in Section~\ref{sec:theorBack-SavitzkyGolay} we explain the \emph{Savitzky-Golay filtering} used for smoothing, velocity and acceleration approximation.

\section{Geometric Monitoring of Distributed Streams} \label{sec:theorBack-GM}

The Continuous Distributed Monitoring Model, a.k.a. Data Stream System (definition)

idea: having a real-time overview over the system
	differing from tradition DBMS: push paradigm vs pull paradigm, continuous queries

application examples: ISP network traffic, distributed sensors etc

complexity: monitoring value or threshold monitoring over the whole set of observations, in real time
			monitoring an arbitrary function (non linear function example), 
			arbitrary number of features

goal: minimize communication while retaining the highest accuracy possible

possible solutions:\\
	1.centralize\\
		- suffers from network overload, storage overload\\
	2.poll\\
		- not real time, update frequency-accuracy trade-off\\
	3.GM monitoring\\
	    -apply convex opt theory in order to reduce communication while retaining accuracy bounds
