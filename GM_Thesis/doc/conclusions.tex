\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:concFuture-conc}



problem statement in short\\
what has been done in short\\
our contributions\\
mop
sg
distance based node matching
directly applicable with the rest of the work done on GM
synthetic and actual data
explored node scalability
oprimal selection of sg parameters
good performance on linear and smooth steams
short explanation of contributions 

\section{Future Work} \label{sec:concFuture-future}

parameter estimation algorithm for sg
sophisticated prediction models
gaussian processes
different solvers
apply to the rest of the work to explore interraction
