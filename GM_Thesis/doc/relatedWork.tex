the initial geometric monitoring method Sharfman et al.~\cite{Sharfman2006GM},two scenarios , a geometric approach on monitoring distributed streams with arbitrary functions
some work preceded this for distributed environments:

threshold monitoring of sum of variables~\cite{DilmanReactiveMonitoring}
local thresholds to improve performance of Dilmanm, Keralapura et al.~\cite{KeralapuraCommEfficientThresholdCounts}

coordinator approximate answers on tracking of specific aggregation operations, sum, avg, min\cite{OlstonAdaptiveFiltersContQueries}

monitor k-largest aggregates by enforcing local constraints on nodes, 
resolution process in case of constraint violation to check whether it was a false alarm, like original GM~\cite{BabcockDistributedTopk}

estimating functions over distributed data streams~\cite{GibbonsSimpleFuncEstimationOverUnion, GibbonsDistrStreamAlgosSlidingWindows}

complex aggregate query approximate answering by coordinator node, synopses at distributed nodes and communicate with coordinator when local constraint is violated, significant divergence in local data, employ predicition~\cite{CormodeApproxContQueryingDistrStreams}

unification of complex approximate query answering with GM, reduction of approximate distr stream monitoring to threshold crossing conditions~\cite{Garofalakis2013SketchBasedGM}

arbitrary function, node specific shapes instead of bounding balls, optimal local constraints, node tailored- Safe Zones, violation recovery by hierarchical structure on the basis of disjoint node partitioning, as here
NP-hard in complexity, approximate solutions for low dimentional data~\cite{Keren2013SafeZones}

unification of safe zones with gm, fundamentally the same~\cite{Samoladas2013Unification}

previous work on gm a special case of safe zones, ellipsoidal bounds - minimize volume of bounding region, communication of temporal data, first and second moments - distribution of data, decoupling of the estimate vector as the reference vector for bounding region construction~\cite{Sharfman2012ShapeSensGM}

constraints tailored to fit data distributions at the nodes, propose specific shapes easily computable and tailored to the nodes data distributions - safe zones, hierarchical data clustering for constraint computation and violation resolution~\cite{Keren2014GMHetStreams}

incorporate variety of preditors-prediction models (also velocity and acceleration), generalization of geometric monitoring scheme~\cite{GiatrakosPredictionGM}
