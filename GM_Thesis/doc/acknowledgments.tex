\begin{acknowledgments}

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Vasilis Samoladas for providing me the chance to work with him, for his support of my thesis and for his guiding, immense knowledge and understanding. A heartfelt ``thank you'' should be addressed to my parents, my sister, and my family, without whose love, advice and support none of this would be possible. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to K.Panousis for the helpful discussions and the general silliness, to my friends and, last but certainly not least, I want to thank Dimitra for her love, support, patience and understanding throughout the realization of this thesis.
