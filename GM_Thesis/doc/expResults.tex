\chapter{Experiments} \label{chap:exp}

in order to evaluate the proposed methods compared our algorithms to original GM, hierarchical clustering (mention acronyms). structure of chapter

\section{Data and Setup}


\subsection{Synthetic Data}

how was synthetic data formed, what characteristics do they have
the monitoring function

create synthetic data to evaluate performance under a controled environment, test with different parameters

*images

acronyms

%TODO: include actual dataset?
\subsection{Air Quality Database}

what is air quality database

how were the streams formed and why

chosen functions

\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Node Matching Algorithms}

compare distance based node matching to distribution based node matching and the random selection algorithm with the classic balancing method

*images

\subsection{Balancing methods}

compare classic balancing with heuristic balancing with random selection algorithm

*images

\subsection{Monitoring Synthetic Data}

compare classic random with heuristic distance based matching over a range of nodes, a range of window sizes and a range of orders for SG

*images

%TODO:actual data?
\subsection{Monitoring Air Quality Data}

compare classic random with heristic distance based matching for the actual data, over a range of nodes and sg parameters to check how it affects performance

actual data streams that have great variance and irregularities lead to poor proposed algorithm performance
