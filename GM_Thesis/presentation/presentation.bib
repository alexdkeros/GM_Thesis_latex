abstract="Massive data sets often arise as physically distributed, parallel datastreams, and it is important to estimate various aggregates and statistics on theunion of these streams. This paper presents algorithms for estimating aggregatefunctions over a ``sliding window'' of the N most recent data items in one or morestreams. Our results include:1. For a single stream,we present the first $\epsilon$-approximation scheme for the numberof 1's in a sliding window that is optimal in both worst case time and space.We also present the first $\epsilon$-approximation scheme for the sum of integers in[0..R] in a sliding window that is optimal in both worst case time and space(assuming R is at most polynomial in N). Both algorithms are deterministicand use only logarithmic memory words.2. In contrast, we show that any deterministic algorithm that estimates, to withina small constant relative error, the number of 1's (or the sum of integers) in asliding window on the union of distributed streams requires $\Omega$(N) space.3. We present the first (randomized) ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-approximation scheme for the numberof 1's in a sliding window on the union of distributed streams that uses onlylogarithmic memory words. We also present the first ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-approximationscheme for the number of distinct values in a sliding window on distributedstreams that uses only logarithmic memory words.Our results are obtained using a novel family of synopsis data structures calledwaves.",
